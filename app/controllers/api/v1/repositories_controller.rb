  # The other half of what a sharded run cost, plus the denominator each cost figure was computed
  # over. `duration_seconds` above is a MAX and `machine_seconds` here is a SUM, and on the
  # project's canonical 4-shard fixture they differ by 3.4× — a client reading only the MAX
  # understates the suite's cost, with no caption to warn it the way the Overview panel has one.
  #
  # STRUCTURED COUNTS, NOT PROSE. `TestRun#machine_seconds_coverage` and `#wall_clock_coverage`
  # answer this same question for the panel, but they answer it in English ("slowest of the 3 that
  # reported"), and a machine-readable client cannot act on a sentence without parsing it. So this
  # serializes the counts those sentences are built from and lets the client word it — or not word
  # it at all and just divide.
  #
  # `coverage` keys each figure by the exact JSON name the client reads it under, so there is no
  # guessing which denominator belongs to which number: `coverage.duration_seconds` is how many
  # shards the MAX was taken over, `coverage.machine_seconds` how many the SUM was taken over, and
  # `count` is how many the run has. Today both are `timed_count` — SQL's MAX and SUM skip the same
  # nulls — but each states its own rather than sharing one field, because a client should not have
  # to know that they coincide, and a figure whose coverage is inferred from a neighbour is exactly
  # the honesty gap this block exists to close.
  #
  # `null` — not an empty or zeroed block — for a run with one shard or none, which is the entire
  # unsharded corpus. There is nothing to disambiguate there (one shard's MAX *is* its SUM, zero
  # shards have neither), and `multi_shard?` is the gate every caller must sit behind: `shard_totals`
  # returns a real `0` for a shardless run, so an ungated block would print `count: 0` and a
  # `machine_seconds: null` for a laptop run that reported a perfectly good duration. The KEY stays
  # present in every response, on the same rule `latest_run` itself follows — a client tests one
  # thing (`shards == null` → "not assembled from parts") rather than distinguishing an absent key
  # from a null one.

      # deliberately a `nil?` check for the same reason: a run whose shards genuinely measured 0.0
