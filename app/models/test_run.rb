# One CI run's metadata. Append-only history: the aggregate counts live here, while the current
# state of each test location lives in SpecIntent.
#
# One row is one *run*, which is not the same as one POST: a sharded suite delivers itself over N
# requests and `Ingest::RunRecorder` accumulates every one of them onto the row named by
# `ci_run_id`. The counters are therefore written by the first shard and *incremented in the
# database* by the rest, never read-modify-written — see `Ingest::RunRecorder` for why.
# `ci_run_id` is nil for every run no CI provider named, and those rows never accumulate.
